# What is Selenium Testing

Selenium is testing how a front end works:
- Clicking on certain links (text OR images or anything else) takes you to a certain page
- There is certain data on any pages, such as headers, images or text
- Is the HTML title correct? HTML Description, author any of the metadata can be tested

Selenium runs within Eclipse / Java, uses JUnit for the testing methods
